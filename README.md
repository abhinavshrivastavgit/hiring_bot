# NVIDIA Candidate Filtration Bot (Logic Engine)

## 🎯 Overview
This Python-based decision engine is designed to automate the initial screening of technical talent. It evaluates candidates based on their primary technology stack and their demonstrated "Proof of Work" (GitHub project count).

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Input Sanitization**: Uses `.lower()` to ensure user input is processed correctly regardless of casing or accidental spaces.
- **Conditional Logic**: Implements a multi-layered `if-elif-else` structure to provide tailored feedback to different candidate profiles.
- **PM Logic**: Focuses on "NVIDIA-preferred" skill sets (Python) to align with AI hardware and software development standards.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Environment**: Managed via Virtual Environment (`.venv`)
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub

## 📖 How to Run
